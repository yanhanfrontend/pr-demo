# Immigration to better places

Date: July 15, 2021

# ‌2021.8.1 Why move?

‌Some of my friends had troubles recently, somebody got sick in their family, house and land were flooded by the storm, out of a job, etc, but the government can do nothing for them, this is normal in developing or undeveloped countries.
So, why not moving to the top 10-20 developed countries, our lives have more guarantee when fighting against risk. when you get their passport with over 150 countries visa-free, then you can move anywhere on earth.

It's not related to money, If they are professional in a kind of skills, I can handle all of the procedures of immigration application.

For example, one of my friends is Nurse.

The easiest way to move to the best countries is by nurse or doctor, the scores needn't be the best, just medium is Good enough.
First of all, You are on the way to be a Doctor, if you love this job, you have achieved half success on the way to immigration.
Secondly, the other half factor to success is English, only one key requirement, we had better get band score 6-7 in IELTS.
Then, you are well done, success completely.

I will explain "***why English is so important?"*** in another article, please search the updates in my blog.

## Why to O**ECD?**

‌

I read lots of immigration policies of the whole world, then My final goal only considers the top 20 OECD country lists: US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Australia, Singapore, West & North Europe.

The most developed countries’ group, around the top 30 are good globally, it's probably European Union also.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)

‌

You should know how to choose neighbours and friends in this world, please keep a close relationship with the west, and keep a distance away from the east. Because.

> **North rich, South poor, West civilized, East rude.**
> 

You will not like it in a humid and warm place, many people will have a musty smell and the whole person feels lethargic and not in good spirits. That's why the developed countries around the world are in the cold regions far from the earth's equator.

OECD locate in the North and west area probably, that's why we should choose OECD.

地理分佈規律如此，地球上靠近赤道的低緯度的炎熱地區都是落後貧窮的，所有的發達國家都是在高緯度的寒帶。

# 2021.7.22 Why do I will leave Ukraine again?

Ukraine is good and better than China, but it's not good enough.

烏克蘭很不錯，比中國好，但是還不足夠好。

If you only want to earn money here, enjoy material and leisure life, this is really an ideal place. If there is a higher ideal goal, the pursuit of personal development, this is not a good place, then you have to upgrade, to Western Europe and North America and other developed regions.

如果僅僅是在這裏賺錢，休閒享受，追求物質生活，這真是一個理想之地。如果有更高理想目標，追求個人發展，這裏不是個好地方，那就得升級，往西歐和北美等發達地區去吧。

Depending on the duration of my work visa, I plan to stay here for no more than 2-3 years. In the following times, I will expand my business to North America and Western Europe, and this plan can only be advanced, not postponed.

根據我的工作簽證的期限，我計划在這里停留不超過2-3年。在接下來的時間里，我將業務擴展到北美和西歐，這個計划只能提前，不能延后。

## Corruption

I heard lots of reports about Corruption in Ukraine on the internet before I came here. 

How corrupted is Ukraine?

[https://youtu.be/cZLDpc6rh3w](https://youtu.be/cZLDpc6rh3w)

It's still a developing country, the society is not fair. Corruption is in governance everywhere in this beautiful country. I share some experiences. 

烏克蘭依然是個發展中國家，發現也有不少類似問題，社會並不公正，腐敗的治理無處不在，我分享一些親身經歷：

## My bad experiences in Ukraine

### Consumers' market

**Higher living costs, less income, lower products quality**

**Batteries**

My wireless mouse of PC need batteries, A new battery must be installed every 10 days. yes, the life span is only 10 days, the brand is Kodak, which sounds like the former famous brand of camera and film. it costs 28 UAH(over 1 USD) for each battery, I know the wireless mouse consumes a very little bit of power every day, the quality is so terrible.

**Shoes**

A local friend told me that, the average normal price is between 3000-4000 UAH (115-150 USD), compared to the Ukrainian average income per capita 500 USD, the Cost of living is comparably high, Income and expenses are unbalanced, so this economical phenomenon is abnormal.

I spend 2000 UAH to buy a pair of classic white shoes, the famous American brand converse, no more than 3 months, I found it was worn out, then I ask the service counter of the retailer. they answer my warranty period is only 30 days, then I should cost another 200 UAH to repair it, I had to accept their answer, but quickly they replied again that their repair shop is disability to repair this fabric style shoes, so they can do nothing, I should go to find another place for help.

Intertop is absolutely nice looking shoe shop, but it is just good looking outside, the quality of their products can not be warranty more than 30 days. 

[https://goo.gl/maps/YwTLXDwZBoB4EnHr5](https://goo.gl/maps/YwTLXDwZBoB4EnHr5)

**Conclusion**

1. don't buy shoes below 150 USD at price in undeveloped countries, it's not worth that much by their quality. 
2. anyway, you can spend no more than 15 USD on low-quality shoes. 
3. if you really want to get good brand products, please go to a near flea market, get the same products for less money. [https://goo.gl/maps/PFoTjLRXQhiH5wxg8](https://goo.gl/maps/PFoTjLRXQhiH5wxg8)

the only problem is reputation, if you wear second-hand clothes or shoes, maybe you will be laughed at by your friends, but they may have second-hand wives or husbands, houses or cars. Is it ridiculous?

Anything, I mean **ANYTHING** from digital products such as Mac and iPhone, to clothes such as Nike and Jack Wolfskin, we make a comparison between countries. 

[VS- Value for money](https://www.notion.so/16bad0d55a3b44e4a0ebbf2c5c73f083)

iPhone and Nike are luxurious products to the common people in undeveloped countries, but they are normal prices to the people in developed countries, people earn more money than you but cost less for those good quality products, **you cost more but get lower quality, the world is unfair. don't you feel unbalanced in your heart?**

that's why we should move to developed countries.

### Medical care system

I need to go to see dentists, a colleague recommended a private clinic, it is said the private hospital is more expensive and should be better than the public hospital in Ukraine. it does look great and beautiful from the website and architecture. 

but there are many bugs during the treatment procedure, I have to write email to my doctor as follows:

Dear Doctor Vita,

I don't understand the Ukrainian language, but it's no problem to use a translator, I prefer to read email.

the customer service staff on telegram only accepted my request for taking a report of the treatment plan at least 5 times, they answered there will be a manager reply to me.

I have been waiting for over 1 month, but I have never seen a manager, then I have to stop my following treatments after coming to see dentists several times already.

How is my whole treatment plan:

1. what's my problems with different examinations?
2. how many steps for the whole treatment? 
3. how much cost for each step?
4. how many times I should come at least?

Thanks for your help.

Best regards,

then, I complain to the service quality control department as follows.

there are some problems during the past few times I came to see the doctor:

1. the internet platform, telegram service staff are helpless;
2. department of service quality control does not work, they don't reply to email;
3. it is not friendly to foreigners, cause the language difference;
4. Each department seems good, but the whole systematic organization does not work well.

the service quality control department never reply to me, then I wrote reviews on google map and found there are more negative comments and not recommended notice from other patients. [https://goo.gl/maps/iQvYS94KYKKQQzjq9](https://goo.gl/maps/iQvYS94KYKKQQzjq9)

### **Education system**

One day, the husband of a Ukrainian colleague came to my office and I asked him if he had plans to work and live in the EU, and he said Ukraine is great, why go to the EU?
I said that the EU has a higher level of economy and better quality of education. The husband argued that the quality of education in Ukraine was very good.
I laughed at that, but it seems that even the locals still don't know the local situation well.

某天，一个乌克兰同事的老公来我办公室，我问他是否有计划到欧盟工作和生活，他说乌克兰很好啊，为什么去欧盟？
我说欧盟的经济水平更高，教育质量更好。那个老公辩解说：乌克兰的教育质量很好啊。而且那里东西很贵，理个头发也要300格里夫那。
我听了呵呵一笑，唉，看来即使本地人也还是不太了解当地的国情啊。

One day she said that the Chinese owner of the company had found many young girls who were looking for Ukrainian university degrees, bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees, but none of them had attended classes and the language was not working. All of them asked this colleague to take the exam on their behalf, pass the entrance exam, and then when they graduated, they wrote and defended their dissertations on their behalf, so that they got their diplomas.
Many of these Chinese students are Chinese civil servants or teachers in institutions for example, and get a master's or doctoral degree to get a higher level of salary in the establishment.
It is an iron-clad fact that it is easier to get a diploma in Ukraine, as several international students have confirmed with me. When I asked them how their studies were, they all said in a casual way that they would just mix a diploma here, and many of them don't go to classes and spend their time in business to make money or find girlfriends because Ukraine is famous for its beautiful girls all over the world.
If they come to Ukraine to study, most of them go back to work in China after graduation, and they cannot find a job locally because they don't even know the language yet.

乌克兰的很多人同时干几份工作，我这个女同事也经常上班的时候干各种赚钱的零活儿，一天她说，公司的中国老板找来很多个小姑娘，她们都要拿乌克兰的大学文凭，有本科，硕士，博士，但是她们都没有上过课，语言也不行。都找她去代考，通过入学考试，然后毕业的时候，再代写论文和答辩，这样就拿到文凭了。
这些中国留学生，有不少是中国的公务员，或事业单位的例如教师，拿到硕士或博士文凭，就能在编制内拿到更高一级的工资。
乌克兰的文凭比较容易拿，这是铁定的事实，已经有几个留学生和我证实了，我问他们学习怎么样，他们都吊儿郎当地说，就在这里混个文凭吧。很多人不去上课，把时间花在做生意赚钱，或者找女朋友，因为乌克兰的姑娘漂亮，这在全世界都是出了名的。
如果是来乌克兰留学，他们大多在毕业后回中国工作，在本地是找不到工作的，因为语言都还不会。

I usually hear Chinese students talk about how they can bribe their teachers and if they can't pass the exam, they just give some money to the teachers and the school office staff and then they pass easily, which after all, is only once a year, which is not much.
I've heard that teachers in Ukraine are paid at a very low level, with an undergraduate teacher in business administration earning about $500 a month and a master's tutor not much higher, so many teachers also have other part-time jobs outside.

我通常听到中国学生讲，如何贿赂他们的老师，如果他们不能通过考试，他们只需要给老师和学校办公室的工作人员一些钱，然后就轻松过关了，这毕竟一年才一次，不算多。
听说乌克兰老师的工资水平很低，一个工商管理专业的本科生老师的月薪大概在500美金，硕士生导师也不会更高多少，所以很多老师也在外面有其他兼职工作。

The husband of this colleague should be well aware of this situation, he knows that his wife is helping many Chinese people to take exams and get Ukrainian diplomas on their behalf, he is also aware that most of the Chinese diplomas are fake, he still insists that Ukrainian education is high quality, I believe he is a very patriotic nationalist, not a person with objective cognitive ability, or maybe he doesn't want to tell the truth either.

我这个同事的老公应该很清楚这种情况，他知道自己的老婆在帮很多中国人代考和拿乌克兰文凭的事，他也清楚在这里的中国留学生的文凭很多都是假的，他仍然坚持说乌克兰的教育质量很高，我相信他是个非常爱国的民族主义者，而不是一个有客观认知能力的人，或者是他也不想说真话，他只是想赚中国人的钱，夸大其词地吸引更多中国人来投资和留学。

### Border customs and visas

Last month, I went to the border to Belarus, the location is Novi Yarylovychi Border Crossing Station [https://goo.gl/maps/Qdaqo6166uWBYT2X9](https://goo.gl/maps/Qdaqo6166uWBYT2X9) 

There are too many bad reviews on Google Maps of this border station, people complain the staff extort an open bribe, Yes, Openly. 

Get through the custom and take a visa stamp on the passport, it is very easy and quick, right? I thought it takes no more than 15 minutes, but we had to wait and stand over there, from 4:00 pm to 11:00 pm in a tiny place. 

A guy led us to pass the custom and bribe the staff of different windows, he runs a small visa business in Kyiv, knows a lot about how is the governments job, "**you must give money to the right hands in the window, otherwise, you can not get through**", he said.

I saw the slogan advertisement on each window of the custom "Ukraine fight against corruption", beside the smiling face of the officer in the border administration. [https://nabu.gov.ua/en](https://nabu.gov.ua/en)

If you want to pass the border, you must get a tiny receipt with their signature and stamp, so, you should bribe openly, the money will flow to their private pocket finally, otherwise, they are unhappy, you can not pass through, even after you give money, you still had to wait for many hours, or the whole day&night. 

I came to Ukraine in the normal legal procedure, but why I should pretend to be a Smuggler?

it's really a dark and cold night over there.

## Pros & Cons of Ukraine

### Pros

1. people are innocent, not too much desire of money, be happy easily even when they are not rich in material life.
2. totally freedom to access the Internet, people can express their opinion and comments to the government on social media.
3. big land, fertile soil, good for agriculture development.
4. low commodity price and living cost.
5. a developing country, more business opportunities.
6. quite close to European Union, a passport is free for a Schengen visa.

### Cons

Ukraine is not good enough, but it’s better than china

1. People: are unhappy easily that I totally don’t understand what’s happening. Many young people don't have life goals, missions, career plans, and get lost in simple material life enjoyment, they also don't have appropriately value-view and world-view.
2. Government: the corruptions are in many departments of the developing country. can't provide good welfare and public service for their common people. 
3. Language: People usually don’t speak English, I can’t make many friends here, then we should learn the local language.
4. Pollution: water pollution of the main river, very fishy bad smell.
5. Economics: many people are bad in economic and living conditions. lots of fake and low-quality industrial products from china, such as clothes, electronic products, etc.
6. Very limited fresh vegetables, but too much meat, salt, sugar, fat, so some people are easily over-weight. the industry of health and nutrition should be a good business.

## Poor Ukraine

Ukraine produce air carrier, nuclear weapon, the largest Antonov aircraft on earth etc. high science&technology, they are smart and intelligent;

Ukrainian is named as the battle tribe, so they are strong and brave;

Ukrainian people of both men and women are beautiful;

Ukraine has the largest territory with fertilized Agri field in Europe, they are rich in natural resources of both for foo and industry;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya)

With so many privileges and advantages, but I don't understand.

Why Ukraine could not be a powerful country? 

Why Ukraine could not provide good welfare for people? 

Why is UKRAINE the POOREST country in EUROPE?

### Conclusion

if we can go to the top 20 developed countries,  we will not choose developing country, too many bugs in this society... 乌克兰肯定不是首选，这里还是有挺多弊端的，作为去欧盟的跳板合适。

# 2021.7.1 Why did I should leave China?

因爲中國社會的弊病太多，**所以我離開中國，具體原因可以參考下面章節**，讓你見識一下什麼是中國。

Many friends ask me the above question also, there are many reasons, I answered as follows:

I needn't show a case of how is China, there are more friends show us.

> Foreigners: "Why I left China?"

Why I Changed my Opinion on China [https://youtu.be/ed4ryYokLzU](https://youtu.be/ed4ryYokLzU)

Why I left China for Good! [https://youtu.be/nWgqdfAomVI](https://youtu.be/nWgqdfAomVI)

the above Youtubers are foreigners in China for over 10 years, can speak Chinese fluently, and know this country deeply.

There are more cases in detail talked about by the Chinese themselves.

我为啥非要离开中国？ [https://youtu.be/nnQ53_Yaj2Y](https://youtu.be/nnQ53_Yaj2Y)

A famous history teacher Mr Yuan's speech"Why did I leave the institutional education? History is at the bottom of the discrimination chain of the education system."

## Corruption Index Rank

‌

[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index)[https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl#](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl#)

as you can see on the above links' map, the corrupt countries rank as below roughly:

1. most undeveloped countries: parts of Africa /middle Asia/ North Korea 99% +
2. developing country: China 80% +; Russia/ Ukraine 60% +
3. most developed countries: OECD( North&West Europe, North America) Countries 10% -

‌[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index)

I'm pretty sure, the corrupt level of China is higher than most undeveloped countries, the data rank is wrong, the above website may take bribes from China's government, corruption is everywhere.

‌

I have the experience since I was very young, I have many friends, relatives and family members who work for the government and private companies, I deeply understand that "No corruption, No business in China", it means if you are not corrupted, you don't bribe government leaders, you can not do anything (including do business, go to school, go to see the doctor, etc.) in China, even you want to do a tiny business.

‌

## Hong kong's Dynasty Gone

‌

the legal, educational, economical system is more close to China's mainland since 1997, the year Hongkong come back to China, it will be worse and worse, as Hong Kong people, must leave and go far away to other countries.

‌

## No freedom of expression

I like talking about environmental and other public issues, it's not politics, right? but it's very dangerous behaviour also. 

The police warned me that they can find me even in other countries, then I will be arrested.

‌How they can pay attention to more than 1 billion people, Even 5 million ch citizens abroad? it's incredible right? they have a strong internet firewall, media monitor.

## Propaganda

Because I usually talk about my bad experiences in China, so relatively I have more praise words to the most developed countries in the western world.

Then, a girl described me as the one who thinks Overly idealistic view of the Western world as " ..the grass is always greener on the other side".

This is similar to the proverb that "other people's things are always good, other people's wives are always beautiful, and people are always feeling unsatisfied with themselves".

Some people are satisfied with a specific environment, but some people get sick and even death. I'm a refugee that escaped from China in fact, because I love talking about the environment and public affairs, I worked as a volunteer for NGOs for over 10 years in China, its' very dangerous with all these political issues over there, some of my friends were arrested, I'm lucky and survived till now.

This girl doesn't care about or respect my life, I tell something true and objective by my experience.

at last, she said, " I love China". I asked her why? she replied "China is beautiful, strong, and powerful"

these are typical of China's propaganda words. She has never been to China, she has no Chinese friends, she doesn't understand the Chinese language and the real situation over there. but she says" I love ***".

Some people live in the western world, they have press free, saying free, but they don't have independent thinking and world view. they still believe Lies of Deception. what a pity!

China's propaganda is really successful.

‌

‌

## Leave away from the Chinese social circle

‌

Most importantly as a Chinese, if you want to have better development, in undeveloped countries abroad, such as If you stay in Ukraine for long-term residence, you should leave away from the local Chinese circle, or you had better immigrate to other powerful countries that can protect you.

I don’t want to share and comment on the other aspects of Personality defects and faults among most part of Chinese.

If you want to know the truth, why are you so critical comments to the people from your motherland? please login to any abroad Chinese chat group, such as Telegram, Whatsapp, Wechat, etc. what’s the comments to Chinese from Chinese? 

Many Chinese immigrants would tell you about their bad experiences, it’s about how the Chinese cheat and fraud other newcomers from China.

The Chinese do not dare to defraud other foreigners; they only dare to deal with the Chinese.

So, they force smarter Chinese have to study foreign languages and leave away from Chinese social circle abroad.

> **‌I feel shame on my Chinese face, I discriminate against myself's nationality.
when somebody asks about my nationality, I would rather reply I’m from Singapore, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hongkong, Vietnam or other Asian countries, except China.**
> 

這是關於中國人的問題，為何遠離海外華人圈？

作為華人，最重要的是，如果你想在海外有更好的發展，尤其是在發展中或落后國家，你必須遠離大陸華人圈，因為已經分享太多原因，在此我不想更多評價中國人的普遍劣根性。

有一種方法可以獲得真相，請加入海外華人的各種聊天群，可以是Telegram, Whatsapp, Wechat
等等，請聽聽里面剛離開大陸的中國人所經曆的糟糕故事，他們如何在海外和中國大陸遭遇各種欺詐的，中國人是如何評價自己同胞的？

[https://youtu.be/eMeyRuREUPM](https://youtu.be/eMeyRuREUPM)

總之，中國人在海外不敢欺壓外國人，他們只敢欺壓中國人，當他們需要你的（錢，社會關係，各種有利可圖資源）的時候，就親切地稱呼你爲“同胞”，當得不到或騙完之後，他們就會把你當做牲口一樣侮辱和對待。

因此，這樣會迫使更多聰明的中國人學習外語，遠離大陸和海外的華人社交圈，中國人永遠都不可能實現全體團結，因爲本來就不存在大一統的中國，只有局部和小地區的利益共同體。

## How are Chinese businessmen?

In such a society like China, it is not possible to make a big business through legal means, always be forced to engage in grey-black transactions, you do not do it, your fellow competitors will do so, then you are not in the same starting line race, you are willing to participate in such a race? I absolutely do not want to.

Almost all of the Chinese businessmen I know pursue this model of development. They like and excel at "maintaining good personal relationships with leaders, privileging beyond the law, and trading under the rules", and I emphasize that most Chinese businessmen are like this.

Not only businessmen, but also in the field of education, where many parents and students must maintain good personal relationships with principals and teachers and offer bribes in secret so that quality educational resources can be allocated to them, and similar rules of engagement prevail in every industry.

You may think I am biased against Chinese society, but I am not exaggerating. I swear in my life that what I say is objectively true, and that is why I do not look forward to working with the Chinese.

在這樣的社會裏，不太可能通過合法的方式做成大事業，總是要被迫從事灰黑色交易，你不去做，你的同行競爭對手會這麼做，那麼你們就不是在同一條起跑線上賽跑了，你願意參與這樣的競賽嗎？我絕對不願意。

我所認識的中國商人，幾乎都追求這樣的發展模式，他們喜歡並擅長“和領導保持良好的私人關係，超出法律範圍的特權，潛規則的交易”，我強調是大多數中國商人都是這樣的。

不僅僅是商人，包括教育領域，許多的家長學生也必須和校長老師保持良好的私人關係，暗中給予賄賂，這樣才能將優質的教育資源分配給他們，每個行業都通行類似的交易規則。

你可能覺得我對中國社會有偏見，這絕對沒有誇張，我用生命擔保，向上帝發誓，我說的是客觀真實的，這是我不想與中國人合作的原因。

‌

# Why did I come to Ukraine?

‌

A friend of businessman invites me to work with him in Ukraine, so I come here, we start up a new company.

Recently, I got my certificate of a **permit for employment of foreigners,** then I can get a **Residence permit for long-term staying in Ukraine,** which is very important for me.

Although I can not recognize the Ukrainian characters, I still found some bugs in the official documents,  my private information and credentials were used to register in the company without my permission in advance, so the negotiation is not enough sometimes between business partners.

people around me can not have good communication usually in China, what's more, Chinese businessmen are always telling lies. it’s been a very common situation for a long long time, China is very conservative and too old, they close the door, and don’t communicate with the western world. we are too far away from civilization. so not only businessmen but also people in every aspect of every industry, they don’t follow the rules and destroy the contracts easily.

So I should leave China, go abroad, I feel good right now, it’s better than living in China. I want to stay here for the long term, but the Chinese business partners are always really terrible. I should leave my current position, and consider what’s my solution for the next steps, how to solve this kind of problem? If I will lose my certificate of work and residence permit? what troubles will be in front of me?
