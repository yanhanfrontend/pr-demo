# Immigration to better places

Date: July 15, 2021

# ‌2021.8.1 Why move?

‌Some of my friends had troubles recently, somebody got sick in their family, house and land were flooded by the storm, out of a job, etc, but the government can do nothing for them, this is normal in developing or undeveloped countries.
So, why not moving to the top 10-20 developed countries, our lives have more guarantee when fighting against risk. when you get their passport with over 150 countries visa-free, then you can move anywhere on earth.

It's not related to money, If they are professional in a kind of skills, I can handle all of the procedures of immigration application.

For example, one of my friends is Nurse.

The easiest way to move to the best countries is by nurse or doctor, the scores needn't be the best, just medium is Good enough.
First of all, You are on the way to be a Doctor, if you love this job, you have achieved half success on the way to immigration.
Secondly, the other half factor to success is English, only one key requirement, we had better get band score 6-7 in IELTS.
Then, you are well done, success completely.

I will explain "***why English is so important?"*** in another article, please search the updates in my blog.

## Why to O**ECD?**

‌

I read lots of immigration policies of the whole world, then My final goal only considers the top 20 OECD country lists: US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Australia, Singapore, West & North Europe.

The most developed countries’ group, around the top 30 are good globally, it's probably European Union also.
